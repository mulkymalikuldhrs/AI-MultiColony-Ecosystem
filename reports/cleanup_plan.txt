# Cleanup Plan

## Files to Delete (Temporary/Build Artifacts)
- *.pyc
- *.swp
- .DS_Store
- /build/ (and its contents)
- /dist/ (and its contents, specific to each UI build)

## Directories to Archive (Legacy UIs)
- /web-interface/ui/
- /web-interface/src/ (Next.js)
- /web-interface/static/
- /web-interface/templates/

## Files to Consolidate/Review
- All `requirements*.txt` files should be consolidated into `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
- All `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files outside of `web-interface/react-ui` should be reviewed and potentially removed if they are part of legacy UI setups. The root `package.json` should be the master for project-level scripts.
- `inventory.py` and `generate_report.py` should be removed after use.
- `check_structure_and_syntax.py` should be moved to a `/scripts` directory.
