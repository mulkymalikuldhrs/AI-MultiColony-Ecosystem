Refactoring Summary for `ROO` Agent

This refactoring focused on the `src/agents/output_components/` module and its orchestrator, `src/agents/output_handler.py`. The primary goal was to improve code quality by adhering to clean code principles without altering the core business logic.

Key Changes:

1.  **Centralized Timestamp Generation:**
    *   Removed multiple `datetime.now()` calls scattered across `ResultCollector`, `ConflictResolver`, and `ReportGenerator`.
    *   A single timestamp is now generated in `OutputHandler.process_task` and passed down to all components.
    *   This ensures temporal consistency for the entire output generation process and adheres to the DRY principle.

2.  **Improved Encapsulation:**
    *   The `_extract_all_deliverables` method in `ReportGenerator` was made public (`extract_all_deliverables`).
    *   `OutputHandler` now calls this public method instead of a protected one, respecting encapsulation boundaries.

3.  **Enhanced Code Clarity and Maintainability:**
    *   Method signatures in the components were updated to accept the timestamp parameter, making the data flow more explicit.
    *   The overall structure is now more robust and easier to maintain.

The module is now in a cleaner state, ready for future development.
