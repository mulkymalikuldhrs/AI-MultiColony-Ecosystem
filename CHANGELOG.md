# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-05
### Added
- Introduced `CHANGELOG.md` to begin tracking changes in a structured manner.
- Added `scripts/agentic_refactorer.py`: a CLI utility for scanning the repository, detecting mock/placeholder files, locating exact file duplicates, and optionally cleaning them up with automatic backups.

### Analysis
- Performed initial repository scan (root level). Major top-level entries include:
  - Directories: `.git`, `agents/`, `examples/`, `data/`, `database/`, `core/`, `config/`, `connectors/`, `build/`, `research/`, `sandbox/`, `src/`, `web_interface/`, `os_automation/`, `tests/` and several others.
  - Key launch scripts detected such as `UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM_LAUNCHER.py`, `system_launcher.py`, and `launcher.py`.
  - Documentation and report files (Markdown, PDF, DOCX) occupy a significant portion of the repository.

Further detailed findings, fixes and improvements will be appended under subsequent versions as the audit and refactor process progresses.

### Lint / Syntax Scan
- Executed `python scripts/agentic_refactorer.py --path .` and saved detailed output to `analysis_report.txt`.
  - Mock / placeholder files detected: **132**
  - Exact duplicate files detected: **7**
- Ran `flake8` across entire repository (captured in `flake8_report.txt`).
  - Total issues reported: **~13.6K**
  - Top categories:
    - `W293` blank line contains whitespace — 8 408 occurrences
    - `E501` line too long (>79 chars) — 3 413 occurrences
    - `F401` unused imports — 476 occurrences
    - `E302` expected 2 blank lines — 394 occurrences
    - `W291` trailing whitespace — 423 occurrences
    - Numerous other style and syntax warnings/errors (see report for full list)

These numbers provide a baseline for upcoming refactor iterations. Subsequent commits will chip away at these counts.

### Execution Flow Mapping
- Identified **7** main executable entry-points (Python):
  1. `UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM_LAUNCHER.py` – async, feature-rich master launcher; dynamically imports and orchestrates `ADVANCED_AI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION`, `FUTURISTIC_UI_SYSTEM`, `MASSIVE_AUTONOMOUS_RESEARCH_ENGINE`. Provides CLI / Web / Sandbox / Termux modes.
  2. `UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM_LAUNCHER_SIMPLE.py` – dependency-light variant; swaps `psutil` for custom `SimpleSystemMonitor`; same component graph with mock fallbacks if validation fails.
  3. `system_launcher.py` – "Ultimate AGI Force" health-check bootstrap; verifies Python, installs pip packages, creates directories, probes connectors (`connectors.llm_gateway`), agents (`agents.*`), and launches `main.py` + Flask web interface.
  4. `launcher.py` – direct startup script; leverages `src.core.*` modules (prompt_master, memory_bus, scheduler, sync_engine, ai_selector), initializes agents via `agents.initialize_agents`, then spins up embedded Flask-SocketIO web-UI and task-queue loops.
  5. `standalone_launcher.py` – fully offline mode; uses `fallback_imports` to stub external libs, builds simplified in-memory versions of MemoryBus / PromptMaster / LLMGateway / CamelAgent; starts a simulated web server & task queue.
  6. `launch_futuristic_system.py` – orchestrates sub-components via separate subprocesses, monitors via `psutil`; emphasises monitoring & graceful restart.
  7. `main.py` – high-level coordinator; selects among `launcher`, `UltimateEcosystemIntegrator`, or standalone fallbacks depending on import availability, then maintains autonomous loops.

- Observed **overlapping responsibility** across launchers (directory creation, dependency install, health checks). Recommendation: converge toward a single canonical launcher class & reuse shared utilities.

### Core / Agent Component Relationships
- Core service layer (`src/core/`): prompt_master, memory_bus, scheduler, sync_engine, ai_selector.
- Connectors: `connectors/llm_gateway` exposes multiple LLM providers; consumed by agents & launchers.
- Agents layer (`agents/`): provides `initialize_agents()` and `AGENTS_REGISTRY` plus specialised agents (Camel, etc.).
- UI layer (`web_interface/`): Flask/SocketIO app referenced by several launchers.
- Research / Orchestration engines: separate monolithic scripts (e.g., `MASSIVE_AUTONOMOUS_RESEARCH_ENGINE.py`) imported by unified launchers.

Inter-dependencies:
- Launchers → Core + Agents + Connectors + UI
- Agents (Camel, etc.) ← Connectors (LLM gateway)
- Core scheduler ↔ Agents via task queue

### Functionality Verification (initial)
- Import smoke-tests succeeded for `system_launcher` targets during launch sequence (no runtime executed here).
- Existence confirmed for referenced modules above **except**:`ADVANCED_AI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.py` (needs follow-up check – may be missing/renamed).
- Web-interface endpoints compile but flake8 flags >200 unused imports & 3 syntax errors (E999) that may break runtime.

Next Steps (planned)
1. Locate & validate `ADVANCED_AI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.py` and other referenced modules; patch missing ones or adjust imports.
2. Deduplicate launcher logic – propose refactor toward `core/launcher_base.py` with shared helpers.
3. Continue agent–connector integration tests & unit test execution.
