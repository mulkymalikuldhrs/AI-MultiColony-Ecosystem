## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-05
### Added
- Introduced `CHANGELOG.md` to begin tracking changes in a structured manner.
- Added `scripts/agentic_refactorer.py`: a CLI utility for scanning the repository, detecting mock/placeholder files, locating exact file duplicates, and optionally cleaning them up with automatic backups.

### Analysis
- Performed initial repository scan (root level). Major top-level entries include:
  - Directories: `.git`, `agents/`, `examples/`, `data/`, `database/`, `core/`, `config/`, `connectors/`, `build/`, `research/`, `sandbox/`, `src/`, `web_interface/`, `os_automation/`, `tests/` and several others.
  - Key launch scripts detected such as `UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM_LAUNCHER.py`, `system_launcher.py`, and `launcher.py`.
  - Documentation and report files (Markdown, PDF, DOCX) occupy a significant portion of the repository.

Further detailed findings, fixes and improvements will be appended under subsequent versions as the audit and refactor process progresses.
