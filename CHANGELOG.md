## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-05
### Added
- Introduced `CHANGELOG.md` to begin tracking changes in a structured manner.
- Added `scripts/agentic_refactorer.py`: a CLI utility for scanning the repository, detecting mock/placeholder files, locating exact file duplicates, and optionally cleaning them up with automatic backups.

### Analysis
- Performed initial repository scan (root level). Major top-level entries include:
  - Directories: `.git`, `agents/`, `examples/`, `data/`, `database/`, `core/`, `config/`, `connectors/`, `build/`, `research/`, `sandbox/`, `src/`, `web_interface/`, `os_automation/`, `tests/` and several others.
  - Key launch scripts detected such as `UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM_LAUNCHER.py`, `system_launcher.py`, and `launcher.py`.
  - Documentation and report files (Markdown, PDF, DOCX) occupy a significant portion of the repository.

Further detailed findings, fixes and improvements will be appended under subsequent versions as the audit and refactor process progresses.

### Lint / Syntax Scan
- Executed `python scripts/agentic_refactorer.py --path .` and saved detailed output to `analysis_report.txt`.
  - Mock / placeholder files detected: **132**
  - Exact duplicate files detected: **7**
- Ran `flake8` across entire repository (captured in `flake8_report.txt`).
  - Total issues reported: **~13.6K**
  - Top categories:
    - `W293` blank line contains whitespace — 8 408 occurrences
    - `E501` line too long (>79 chars) — 3 413 occurrences
    - `F401` unused imports — 476 occurrences
    - `E302` expected 2 blank lines — 394 occurrences
    - `W291` trailing whitespace — 423 occurrences
    - Numerous other style and syntax warnings/errors (see report for full list)

These numbers provide a baseline for upcoming refactor iterations. Subsequent commits will chip away at these counts.
