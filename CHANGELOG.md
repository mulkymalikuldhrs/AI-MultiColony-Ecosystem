# [7.2.0] - 2025-07-06

### 🆕 SYSTEM STATUS & INTEGRATION

- ✅ All launchers merged: Only `main.py` and `unified_launcher.py` are used. Interactive mode selection (Web UI, CLI, Termux, etc) at startup.
- ✅ Web UI fully functional: Real-time dashboard for agents, logs, tasks, sandbox, monitoring, credential manager, and AI Core panel. Access at http://localhost:8080 or http://YOUR_IP:8080
- ✅ LLM7 API enforced: All agents and LLM Gateway use LLM7 public endpoint (`LLM7_API_KEY=unused`, `LLM7_BASE_URL=https://api.llm7.io/v1`).
- ✅ ColonyCore rule enforced: Only Mulky Malikul Dhaher (owner) can be ColonyCore.
- ✅ All agent/colony/task management, logs, and metrics are exposed in the Web UI.
- ⚠️ Some agents/features require extra dependencies: (redis, cv2, paramiko, cryptography, docker, arxiv, nltk, etc). Install these for full functionality.
- ⚠️ LLM7 API is public/free: If completions fail, check LLM7 server status or rate limits.
- ⚠️ CLI only supports documented commands: Custom/unknown commands will return `Unknown command`.

#### Known Issues
- Some agents/modules require extra Python packages (see logs for missing modules).
- LLM7 completions may fail if the public server is down or rate-limited.
- Only supported CLI commands will work; others will return `Unknown command`.
- All system logs are in `logs/colony_activity.log`.

- **UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM_LAUNCHER_SIMPLE.py**: Simplified version removed  
- **standalone_launcher.py**: Merged into unified system
- **system_launcher.py**: Consolidated into unified launcher
- **launcher.py**: Old launcher replaced by unified version
- **ecosystem_integrator.py**: Integrated into unified system
- **launch_futuristic_system.py**: Futuristic features merged

#### 🔧 Fixed  
- **Port Conflicts**: Changed default port from 5000 to 8080 to avoid conflicts
- **Network Access**: Web UI now accepts connections from any IP (0.0.0.0)
- **Multiple Launcher Confusion**: ALL launchers consolidated into one system
- **Mode Complexity**: Simplified from 7 confusing modes to 5 clear modes
- **External Access**: Users can now access from other devices on network
- **Documentation**: Updated README with new architecture and port information

#### 🏗️ Improved
- **Project Structure**: Cleaner hierarchy with proper separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Enhanced README.md with actual running capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling and graceful degradation
- **Resource Management**: Optimized memory and CPU usage
- **Security**: Better input validation and sanitization

#### 🗑️ Removed
- **Obsolete Launchers**: Removed redundant launcher files
- **Mock Data**: Cleaned up all placeholder and demo data
- **Unused Dependencies**: Removed unused packages and imports
- **Duplicate Code**: Consolidated duplicate functionality

### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### For Users
1. Use the new unified launcher: `python unified_launcher.py`
2. Select your preferred mode from the interactive menu
3. Web UI is now available at http://localhost:5000
4. All outputs are saved to `agent_output/` directory

#### For Developers
1. All agents are now registered in the unified system
2. Use the task queue system for agent communication
3. Configuration is loaded from `config/system_config.yaml`
4. Check `logs/colony_activity.log` for system activity

### 🌟 Technical Highlights (UPDATED)

- **🚀 Single Unified Launcher**: One entry point for all system functions
- **🌐 Multi-device Web Access**: Port 8080, accessible from any network device  
- **📱 Simplified User Experience**: Only 5 modes instead of confusing 7 modes
- **⚡ Faster Startup**: Reduced launcher complexity = faster boot time
- **� Better Network Support**: External access enabled by default
- **📊 Enhanced Architecture**: Clear system flow with mermaid diagrams
