- ~~"Enterprise-grade scalability"~~ (Reality: Development prototype)

#### **✅ ADDED HONEST DESCRIPTIONS:**

##### **Realistic Project Status:**
- ✅ **"Development Platform"** instead of "Production System"
- ✅ **"Agent Organization Framework"** instead of "Real AI Creation"
- ✅ **"Basic Credential Management"** instead of "Military-Grade Security"
- ✅ **"Development Stage"** instead of "Production Ready"

##### **Accurate Feature Descriptions:**
- ✅ **Working Features** clearly identified
- ✅ **In Development Features** honestly marked
- ✅ **Not Implemented Features** explicitly listed
- ✅ **Implementation Levels** honestly described

##### **Realistic Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Agent Templates** (not dynamic AI creation)
- ✅ **Basic Encryption** (not military-grade)
- ✅ **Development Framework** (not production system)
- ✅ **Learning Platform** (not enterprise solution)
