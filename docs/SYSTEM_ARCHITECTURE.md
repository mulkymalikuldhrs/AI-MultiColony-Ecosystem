# AI-MultiColony-Ecosystem System Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-MultiColony-Ecosystem system architecture, including component structure, data flow, and interaction patterns.

## System Overview

The AI-MultiColony-Ecosystem is a comprehensive platform for building, managing, and deploying AI agents that work together to solve complex tasks. The system is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Registry

The agent registry (`colony/core/agent_registry.py`) is the central component of the ecosystem. It manages agent registration, discovery, and instantiation.

```python
# Agent registration
@register_agent
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    """My custom agent."""
    # ...

# Agent discovery
agents = list_all_agents()

# Agent instantiation
agent_class = get_agent("my_agent")
agent = agent_class()
```

### 2. Base Agent

The base agent (`colony/core/base_agent.py`) provides the foundation for all agents in the ecosystem. It defines the common interface and functionality that all agents must implement.

```python
class BaseAgent:
    """Base class for all agents."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, config=None, memory=None):
        """Initialize the agent."""
        self.name = name
        self.config = config or {}
        self.memory = memory or {}
    
    async def run(self, task):
        """Run the agent on a task."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement run()")
```

### 3. API Server

The API server (`colony/api/app.py`) provides a RESTful API for interacting with the ecosystem. It includes endpoints for agent management, task execution, and system status.

```
/api/agents/                # List all agents
/api/agents/{name}/status   # Get agent status
/api/agents/{name}/run      # Run an agent
/api/agents/{name}/stop     # Stop an agent
/api/agents/{name}/logs     # Get agent logs
```

### 4. WebSocket Server

The WebSocket server (`colony/api/websocket.py`) provides real-time communication for live updates. It includes channels for system updates, agent logs, and chat.

```
/ws/system                  # System updates
/ws/agent/{agent_id}        # Agent logs
/ws/chat                    # Chat
```

### 5. Agent Creator

The agent creator (`colony/api/endpoints/agent_creator.py`) allows for dynamic creation of new agents with custom capabilities.

```python
# Create a new agent
response = create_agent({
    "name": "MyCustomAgent",
    "prompt_template": "You are a helpful assistant that {task_description}...",
    "config": {
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "max_tokens": 1000
    },
    "description": "A custom agent that does something amazing"
})
```

### 6. Web Interface

The web interface (`web-interface/react-ui`) provides a user-friendly way to interact with the ecosystem. It includes pages for agent management, chat, agent creation, deployment, and settings.

## System Flow

### 1. Initialization Flow

```
main.py
  ├── Load configuration
  ├── Initialize agent registry
  ├── Discover and register agents
  ├── Start API server
  ├── Start WebSocket server
  └── Start web interface (if enabled)
```

### 2. Agent Execution Flow

```
API Request
  ├── Validate request
  ├── Get agent from registry
  ├── Create agent instance
  ├── Run agent on task
  ├── Broadcast updates via WebSocket
  └── Return result
```

### 3. Agent Creation Flow

```
Agent Creator Request
  ├── Validate request
  ├── Generate agent code
  ├── Write agent file
  ├── Register agent in registry
  ├── Broadcast update via WebSocket
  └── Return result
```

### 4. WebSocket Communication Flow

```
WebSocket Connection
  ├── Client connects to WebSocket
  ├── Server accepts connection
  ├── Client subscribes to channels
  ├── Server broadcasts updates to channels
  └── Client receives updates
```

## Data Flow

### 1. Agent Registry Data Flow

```
Agent Registration
  ├── Agent class is defined
  ├── @register_agent decorator is applied
  ├── Agent class is added to registry
  └── Agent is available for discovery
```

### 2. Agent Execution Data Flow

```
Task Execution
  ├── Task is created
  ├── Task is assigned to agent
  ├── Agent processes task
  ├── Agent returns result
  └── Result is returned to client
```

### 3. WebSocket Data Flow

```
Real-time Updates
  ├── Event occurs (agent status change, log entry, etc.)
  ├── Event is broadcast to appropriate channel
  ├── Clients subscribed to channel receive update
  └── Clients update UI
```

## Component Interaction

### 1. Agent Registry and API Server

The API server uses the agent registry to discover and instantiate agents. It provides endpoints for listing agents, getting agent status, and running agents.

### 2. API Server and WebSocket Server

The API server and WebSocket server work together to provide real-time updates. When an agent's status changes or a new log entry is created, the API server broadcasts the update via the WebSocket server.

### 3. Web Interface and API Server

The web interface communicates with the API server to get data and perform actions. It uses the API endpoints for agent management, task execution, and system status.

### 4. Web Interface and WebSocket Server

The web interface connects to the WebSocket server to receive real-time updates. It subscribes to channels for system updates, agent logs, and chat.

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Development Environment

```

  ├── Python 3.9+
  ├── Node.js 16+
  ├── AI-MultiColony-Ecosystem
  │   ├── colony/
  │   ├── web-interface/
  │   └── main.py
  └── Web Browser
```

  └── PostgreSQL (optional)
```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication

Authentication is not currently implemented. All endpoints are publicly accessible.

### 2. Authorization

Authorization is not currently implemented. All endpoints are publicly accessible.

### 3. Input Validation

Input validation is implemented for all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

### 4. Error Handling

## Conclusion

The AI-MultiColony-Ecosystem is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization. The system is built around a central agent registry that manages agent registration, discovery, and instantiation. The API server and WebSocket server provide interfaces for interacting with the ecosystem, while the web interface provides a user-friendly way to manage agents and execute tasks.
